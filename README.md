# Profile Card Project â€“ HTML & CSS Basics

## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
This is a simple project I made to demonstrate the basics of **HTML** and **CSS**.  
In this lesson, we built a **Profile Card** step by step, starting from the structure with HTML and then styling it with CSS.  

The goal is to show how HTML provides the **structure** of a webpage, and CSS adds the **style** to make it look nice.
